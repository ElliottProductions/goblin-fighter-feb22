This is Goblin Fighter Online!

It's a very simple game of chance, with a little strategy.

This app uses Node js and Supabase (a relatively new "back-end as a service provider".)

To start, click on the Login button (default values should be auto-populated in the email and password fields.)

This should load the Goblins! Click on a Goblin to attack them, but beware, once you attack a Golbin, he will counter-attack!

Some Goblins have higher attack power than others, but you will have to experiment to find out which ones are the most powerful!

Keep a watch on your HP (Health Points) at the top of the screen.

If you log out and log back in you will find that the Goblin's you left undefeated are still waiting for you!

(However, your health points will have regenerated, a little hint for you ;))

In order to keep track of the Goblin's HP and other attributes the deployed app makes calls to Supabase (a relatively new "back-end as a service provider".)

Once you defeat all the Goblins, you may want to create more Goblins to fight some more!

To do so you must go to: https://lucent-longma-699e99.netlify.app/

Feel free to sign in using the default account that's auto-populated in the Sign-In form.

If you sign-up with your own email and password, make sure to use the same login info to sign into goblin fighter next time, or you won't be able to see and fight the goblins that you created!
